# Starter Project

### Purpose

The Starter combines all of our Best Practice technologies for Most Best Making of Web Development.  Components included are listed below.  
Use as many or as few as you like.  The included index and partials are very basic and lifted from HTML5BP with the addition of necessary
components.

### What we got

* HTML5 Boilerplate index
* Bootstrap
* Backbone/Underscore
* Backbone starting framework (modified) - https://bitbucket.org/noblestudios/codebase-backbone-starting-point
* Prototype Starting Point (modified) - https://bitbucket.org/noblestudios/codebase-prototype-starting-point
* Compass/SASS
* Grunt
* Bower

### How to make things tick

* Clone down the repo
* Run "npm install" to grab node modules you need
* Run "grunt" and off you go
* Add "SetEnv SERVER_TYPE production" to the .htaccess file to simulate a production environment (see footer.php). 
* Note: You may need to "touch" a javascript file in app/ and components/ to trigger grunt watch for concat/uglify tasks
